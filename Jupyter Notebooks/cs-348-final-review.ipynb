    "\n",
    "**Data**  \n",
    "Representation of _facts_, _concepts_, or _instructions_ in a formalized manner suitable for communication, interpretation, or processing by humans or by automatic means.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Database**  \n",
    "A _large_ and _persistent_ collection of pieces of information organized in a way that facilitates efficient _retrieval_ and _modification_.\n",
    "\n",
    "**DBMS**  \n",
    "A program (or set of programs) managing details related to storage and access to a database.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Schema**  \n",
    "A description of the data interface to the database; i.e. how the data is organized.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Instance**  \n",
    "A database (real data) that conforms to a given scheme; a schema can, and typically does, have many instances.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Three Level Schema Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "1. External Schema (View)\n",
    "\t- What the application programs and user see.\n",
    "\t- Can differ per user in the same database\n",
    "2. Conceptual Schema\n",
    "\t- Description of logical structure of all data in the database.\n",
    "3. Physical Schema\n",
    "\t- Description of physical aspects (selection of files, devices, storage algorithms, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Independence\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Physical\n",
    "\t- Immune to changes in storage structures\n",
    "2. Logical\n",
    "\t- Immune to changes in data organization\n",
    "\n",
    "### Transaction\n",
    "\n",
    "An application-specific atomic and durable unit of work.\n",
    "Properties of transactions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Atomic\n",
    "\t - a transaction occurs entirely, or not at all\n",
    "2. Consistency\n",
    "\t - each transaction preserves the consistency of the database\n",
    "3. Isolated\n",
    "\t - concurrent transactions do not interfere with each other\n",
    "4. Durable\n",
    "\t - once completed, a transaction's changes are permanent\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Languages\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Definition Language** (DDL): for specifying schema\n",
    "\n",
    "- May have different DDLs for external schema, conceptual schema, internal schema\n",
    "- Information is stored in the _data dictionary_, or _catalog_\n",

    "**Data Manipulation Language** (DML): for specifying queries and updates\n",
    "\n",
    "- _navigational_ (procedural)\n",
    "- _non-navigational_ (declarative)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of Database Users\n",
    "\n",
    "1. End user\n",
    "\t- Access indirectly through forms or other query-generating applications\n",
    "\t- Or generates ad-hoc queries using the DML\n",
    "2. Application developer\n",
    "\t- Designs and implements applications that access the database\n",
    "3. Database administrator\n",
    "\t- Manages conceptual schema\n",
    "\t- Assists with application view integration\n",
    "\t- Monitors and tunes performance\n",
    "\t- Defines internal schema\n",
    "\t- Loads and reformats database\n",
    "\t- Responsible for security and reliability\n",
    "\n",
    "### Benefits of using a DBMS to manage data\n",
    "\n",
    "- Remove common code from applications\n",
    "- Provide uniform access to data\n",
    "- Guarantee data integrity\n",
    "- Manage concurrent access\n",

    "- Data Manipulation Language (DML)\n",
    "    - Query information\n",
    "    - Insert/modify/delete tuples\n",
    "- Integrity\n",
    "    - DDL has commands to enforce integrity constraints on data stored in the database\n",
    "    - Disallow violating data\n",
    "- View Definition\n",
    "    - DDL has commands for defining views\n",
    "- Transaction Control\n",
    "    - SQL has commands for specifying the beginning and ending of transactions\n",
    "- Embedded and Dynamic SQL\n",
    "    - Define how SQL statements can be embedded within general-purpose programming languages\n",

    "- Constants (of appropriate types)\n",
    "- User defined functions (UDF)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Set operations\n",
    "\n",
    "- `UNION`, expresses \"or\" ($\\cup$), `UNION ALL` to retain duplicates\n",
    "- `EXCEPT`, expresses \"and not\" ($-$)\n",
    "- `INTERSECT`, expresses \"and\" ($\\cap$) (redundant, rarely used), `INTERSECT ALL` to retain duplicates\n",
    "\n",
    "Both sets must have union-compatible signatures, same number and types of attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Aggregate Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "- Average: `avg`\n",
    "- Minimum: `min`\n",

    "- an **exclusive lock** is required to write an object\n",

    "Two-phase locking guarantees that the produced transaction schedules are (conflict) serializable\n",
    "\\end{theorem}\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice: _STRICT 2PL_ (locks held until commit; guarantees ACA).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Deadlocks and What to Do\n",
    "\n",
    "With 2PL we may end with a **deadlock**:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$r_{1}[x], r_{2}[x], w_{2}[x](\\text{blocked by }T_{1}), w_{1}[y](\\text{blocked by }T_{2})$$\n",

    "#### Variations on Locking\n",
    "\n",
    "- Multi-granularity locking\n",
    "  - Not all locked objects have the same size\n",
    "  - Advantageous in presence of bulk vs. tiny updates\n",
    "- Predicate locking\n",
    "  - Locks based on selection predicate rather on a value\n",
    "- Tree locking\n",

    "#### Inserts and Deletes\n",
    "\n",
    "What if we try to _insert_ or _delete_ an item?\n",
    "\n",
    "Does plain 2PL (correctly) handle this situation? No!\n",
    "\n",
    "- One transaction tries to count records in a table\n",
    "- Second transactions adds/deletes a record\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Four **isolation levels** are supported:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Level 3: (serializability)\n",
    "  - Essentially table-level strict 2PL\n",
    "- Level 2: (repeatable read)\n",
    "  - Tuple-level strict 2PL; \"phantom tuples\" may occur\n",
    "- Level 1: (cursor stability)\n",
    "  - Tuple-level exclusive-lock only strict 2PL\n",
    "  - Reading the same object twice may lead to different values\n",

    "  \n",
    "### Recovery: Goals and Setting\n",
    "\n",
    "Goals:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Allow transactions to be\n",
    "  - **committed** (with a guarantee that the effects are permanent)\n",
    "  - **aborted** (with a guarantee that the effects disappear)\n",
    "2. Allow the database to be **recovered** to a consistent state in case on hardware/power/... failure\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: a 2PL, ACA schedule of operations produced by Transaction Manager.  \n",
    "Output: a schedule of reads/writes/**forced writes**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Approaches to Recovery\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Shadowing\n",
    "  - Copy-on-write and merge-on-commit approach\n",
    "  - Poor clustering\n",
    "  - Used in system R, but not in modern systems\n",
    "2. Logging\n",
    "  - Use of logs (separate disk) to avoid forced writes\n",
    "  - Good utilization of buffers\n",
    "  - Preserves original clusters\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Log-Based Approaches\n",
    "\n",
    "A log is a read/**append only** data structure (a file), transactions add **log records** about what they do.\n",
    "\n",
    "Log records contain several types of information:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **UNDO**: old versions of objects that have been modified by a transaction.\n",
    "  UNDO information can be used to undo database changes made an aborted transaction.\n",
    "- **REDO**: new versions of objects that have been modified by a transaction.\n",
    "  REDO records can be used to redo the work done by a committed transaction.\n",
    "- **BEGIN/COMMIT/ABORT**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Write-Ahead Logging (WAL)\n",
    "\n",
    "Requires:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **UNDO** rule: a **log record** for an update is written to log disk **before** the corresponding data (page) is written to the main disk (guarantees _Atomicity_)\n",
    "2. **REDO** rule: **all log records** for a transaction are written to log disk before **commit** (guarantees _Durability_)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "ACID properties guarantee correctness of concurrent access to the database and of data storage.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Consistency and isolation based on **serializability**\n",
    "  - Leads to definition of correct **schedulers**  \n",
    "  - Responsibility of the **transaction manager**\n",
    "- Durability and atomicity\n",
    "  - responsibility of the **recovery manager**\n",
    "  - synchronous writing is too inefficient, replaced by synchronous writes to a LOG and WAL\n"

    "1. Horizontal Partitioning\n",
    "  - Each partition has all the original columns and a subset of the original rows\n",
    "  - Tuples are assigned to a partition based upon a (usually natural) criteria\n",
    "  - Often used to separate operational from archival data\n",
    "2. Vertical Partitioning\n",
    "  - Each partition has a subset of the original columns and all the original rows\n",
    "  - Typically used to separate frequently-used columns from each other (concurrency hot-spots) or from infrequently-used columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tuning Queries\n",
    "\n",
    "Changes to the physical or conceptual schemas impacts _all_ queries and updates in the workload.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes desirable to target performance of specific queries or applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Guideline:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Sorting is expensive. Avoid unnecessary uses of `ORDER BY`, `DISTINCT`, or `GROUP BY`\n",
    "2. Whenever possible, replace subqueries with joins\n",
    "3. Whenever possible, replace correlated subqueries with uncorrelated subqueries\n",
    "4. Use vendor-supplied tools to examine generated plan.\n",
    "  Update and/or create statistics if poor plan is due to poor cost estimation\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Tuning Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "Guidelines:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Minimize communication costs\n",
    "  - Return the fewest columns and rows necessary\n",
    "  - Update multiple row with a `WHERE` clause rather than a cursor\n",
    "2. Minimize lock contention and hot-spots\n",
    "  - Delay updates as long as possible\n",
    "  - Delay operations on hot-spots as long as possible\n",
    "  - Shorten or split transactions as much as possible\n",
    "  - Perform insertions/updates/deletions in batches\n",
    "  - Consider lower isolation levels\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "- Physical design has _significant impact_ on performance.\n",
    "- Decisions based on _understanding_ what the DBMS is doing; query execution, transaction processing, and query optimization\n",
    "- Modern systems provide tools (`EXPLAIN`)"
