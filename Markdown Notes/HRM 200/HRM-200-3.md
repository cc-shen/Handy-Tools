## Chapter 11 - Strategic Pay Plans

**Employee compensation** includes all forms of pay going to employees and arising from their employment.  
It has two main components,

- Direct financial payments
	- wages, salaries, incentives, commissions, and bonuses
- Indirect financial payments
	- financial benefits, i.e. employer-paid insurance and vacation

### Aligning Total Rewards with Strategy

Compensation plan should first advance the firm's strategic aims--management should produce an aligned reward strategy.  
This means creating a package that produces the employee behaviours the firm needs to achieve its competitive strategy.

Question: _Do our compensation policies support our strategic aims?_

- What are our strategic aims?
- What employee behaviours and skills do we need to achieve our strategic aims?
- What compensation policies and practices--salary, incentive plans, and benefits--will help to produce the employee behaviours we need to achieve our strategic aims?

### Five Components of Total Rewards

1. Compensation
2. Benefits
3. Work-life programs
4. Performance and recognition
5. Development and career opportunities

### Impact of Rewards

Rewards are to attract, retain, motivate and engage employees.  
_Engagement_ refers to a positive emotional connection to the employer and a clear understanding of the strategic significance of the job, which results in discretionary effort on the part of the employee.

### Basic Considerations in Determining Pay Rates

- Legal considerations
	- Employment/Labour Standards Act
	- Pay Equity Acts
	- Human Rights Acts
	- Canada/Quebec Pension Plan
	- Other legislation (worker's comp., EI)
- Union influences
- Compensation policies
- Equity and its impact on pay rates

### Establishing Pay Rates

#### Stage 1: Job Evaluation

A systematic comparison to determine relative worth of jobs within a firm.

- Benchmark job
	- Critical to operations or commonly found in other organizations
- Compensable factors
	- Fundamental, compensable element of a job

**Job Evaluation Methods**  
Classification/Grading Method

- Categories jobs into groups
- Grade/group description: outline the level of compensable factors required by each job

Point Method

- Identify compensable factors
- Determine the degree to which each factor is present in each job

Point Method Steps

1. Preliminary steps
2. Determine factor weights and degrees
3. Assign points for each degree of each sub-factor
4. Evaluate the jobs

#### Stage 2: Conduct Wage/Salary Survey

- Aimed at determining prevailing wage rates
	- Determine rates for benchmark jobs
	- Determine market rates for jobs
	- Collect data on benefits, recognition programs, etc.
- Avoid upward bias
- Informal surveys good for easily recognized jobs
- Formal surveys are most comprehensive

#### Stage 3: Combine Job Evaluation and Salary Survey to Determine Pay

**Wage Curve**  
A graphic description of the relationship between the value of the job and the average wage paid for this job.

**Pay Ranges**  
A series of steps of levels within a pay grade, usually based on years of service.

**Boardbanding**  
Reducing the number of salary grades and ranges into just a few wide levels or "bands", each of which then contains a relatively wide range of jobs and salary levels.  
Advantage is the greater flexibility in employee compensation.

### Pay for Knowledge

- Competency-based pay
	- managers, professionals
- Skill-based pay
	- manufacturing employees

Pay-for-knowledge program should include:

- Competencies/skills directly important to job performance
- New competencies that replace competencies that are no longer important
- On-the-job training, not "in the classroom"

### Pay for Executive, Managerial and Professional Jobs

Developing a compensation plan to pay executive, managerial, and professional employees is similar in many respects to developing a plan for other employees.

The basic aims of the plan are the same in that goal is to attract good employees and maintain their commitment.

Executives, managers, and professionals are almost always paid based on their performance as well as on the basis of static job demands, like working conditions.

### Five Elements of Compensating Executives and Managers

1. Salary
2. Benefits
3. Short-term incentives
4. Long-term incentives
5. Perquisites

### Compensating Professional Employees

- Engineers, scientists, accountants, lawyers, etc.
- Compensable factors not easily measured: creativity, problem solving
- Difficult to measure economic impact to organization
- Market-pricing approach commonly used

### Pay Equity

Wage gap has narrowed but remains at 30%.  
Gap attributed to systemic discrimination.

Aim is to provide equal pay to male and female-dominated job classes of equal value.  
Must ensure no gender bias in job evaluation.  
Long-term solution is to eliminate male and female-dominated jobs.
