### A Brief History of HRM

**Scientific Management**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Concern for production; driven by Frederick Taylor.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Scientifically analyzing manufacturing processes to reduce costs and compensating employees based on performance.

**Human Resources Movement**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Concern for people and productivity.

### Human Resources Movement: Evolutionary Phases

Phase 1 - early 1900s

- Personnel adminstration
- Hiring, firing, payroll/benefits processing

Phase 2 - 1930s to 1950s

- Union Liaison, compliance with new laws
- Orientation, performance appraisal, employee relations
- Dealt with impact of _human relations movement_ in the 40s-50s

Phase 3 - 1960s to 1980s

- Human resources management
- Outsourcing of many administrative functions
	- Practice of contracting with outside vendors to handle specified business functions on a permanent basis
- Emphasis on contribution and proactive management of people

Phase 4 - 1990s to present

- Every line manager must possess basic HR skills
- Help achieve strategic objectives
- New roles: activist, change steward, talent manager/organizational designer, operational executor and business ally
- "HR Business Partner"

Human-capital life cycle: selection and assimilation into the organization, and development of capabilities while working in the organization, and transition out of the organization.

### Operational and Strategic Aspects of HRM

**Defn.** (Authority)  
Right to make decisions, direct others' work, and give orders.

**Defn.** (Line Authority)  
The right ot issue orders to other managers or employees.

**Defn.** (Staff Authority)

### Reorganization the HRM Function

#### Evidence-based HRM

- Using best available evidence in making decisions about HR practices.  
- Actual measurements, existing data, research studies.

#### Measuring the Value of HR: Metrics

Traditional measures focused on activity and cost.  
Examples: number of candidates interviewed, cost per hire.

Today's measures focus on productivity, quality, sales, market share, and profits (business operations).  
Examples: turnover/retention, employee performance, engagement scores, time-to-fill, etc.  
_Balanced scorecard_: a measurement system that translates organization's strategy into a comprehensive set of financial and operational performance measures.

### Growing Professionalism in HRM

**Characteristics of a profession**:

- A common body of knowledge
- Performance standards
- Professional association
- External perception as a professional
- Code of ethics
- Required training credentials
- Ongoing skill development
- Maintenance of professional competence

## Chapter 3, Human Resources Management & Technology

## Chapter 4, Designing & Analyzing Jobs

### Fundamentals of Job Analysis

**Defn.** (Job Analysis)  
"_A process by which information about jobs is systematically gathered and organized_."

**Defn.** (Job)  
A group of related activities/duties for one or more employees.

**Defn.** (Position)  
The collection of tasks/responsibilities performed by one person.

**Example**  
45 positions and 4 jobs in a department with 1 supervisor, 1 clerk, 40 assemblers, and 3 tow-motor operators.

@import "Assets/figure-4.1.png"

### Uses of Job Analysis Information

- Human Resources Planning
- Recruitment and Selection
- Compensation
- Performance Management
- Labour Relations
- Training, Development, and Career Management
- Restructuring

### Steps in Job Analysis

1. Review relevant background information
2. Select jobs to be analyzed
3. Collect data on job activities
4. Verify/Modify data if required
5. Write job descriptions and job specifications
6. Communicate and update information as needed

#### 1: Review Relevant Background Information

Organizational Structure

- The formal relationships among jobs in an organization
- Should be appropriate given strategic goals

Organization Chart

- Clarifies chain of command; who reports to whom
- Does not explain communication patterns, degree of supervision, power, authority, or specific duties

@import "Assets/figure-4.2.png"
@import "Assets/figure-4.3.png"
@import "Assets/figure-4.4.png"

#### 2: Select Jobs to be Analyzed

Necessary when there are a number of similar jobs.

**Defn** (Job Design)  
The process of systematically organizing work into tasks that are required to perform a specific job.

##### The Evolution of Jobs and Job Design

Work Simplification  
Assigning most of the administrative aspects of work to supervisors and managers, while giving lower-level employees narrowly defined tasks to perform according to methods established and specified by management.

Job Specialization (early-mid 1900s)

- Work simplification
- Industrial engineering

Industrial Engineering  
Analyzing work methods; making work cycles more efficient by modifying, combining, rearranging, or eliminating tasks; and establishing time standards.

Behavioural Aspects (mid 1900s)

- Job enlargement, job rotation, job enrichment, team-based job design

Job Enlargement (Horizontal Loading)  
A technique to relieve monotony and boredom that involves assigning workers additional tasks at the same level of responsibility to increase the number of tasks they have to perform.

Job Rotation  
A technique to relieve monotony and employee boredom that involves systematically moving employees from one job to another.

Job Enrichment (Vertical Loading)  
Any effort that makes an employee's job more rewarding or satisfying by adding more meaningful tasks and duties.

Ergonomic Aspects (mid-late 1900s)

- Physical needs of workers

##### Competency-Based Job Analysis

Competencies: demonstrable characteristics that enable performance of a job.  
Shift from job-specific duties to competencies in a job descriptions; emphasis on employee capabilities.  
Reasons to use competency analysis:

1. Traditional job descriptions may actually backfire if a _high-performance work system_ is the goal.
2. Describing the job in terms of the skills, knowledge, and competencies the worker needs is _more strategic_.
3. Measurable skills, knowledge, and competencies support the employer's _performance management process_.

Examples of competencies:

- General (reading, writing, mathematics)
- Leadership (strategic thinking, motivating)
- Technical competencies for specific jobs

Use of competency analysis is becoming more common.  
It encourages workers to learn and rotate among jobs.  
More strategic approach to defining jobs.  
Supports performance management process.

##### Team-Based Job Designs

Job designs that focus on giving a team a whole and meaningful piece of work to do and empowering team members to decide among themselves how to accomplish the work.  
They are often cross-trained and then rotated through different tasks.

#### 3: Collecting Job Analysis Information

Interviews (individual, group, supervisory).  
Incumbent: individual currently holding the position.

Questionnaires.  
**PAQ**, Position Analysis Questionnaire: a questionnaire used to collect quantifiable data concerning the duties and responsibilities of various jobs.  
**FJA**, Functional Job Analysis**: quantitative method for classifying jobs based on types and amounts of responsibility for data, people, and things. Performance standards and training requirements are also identified.

Observations.

Participant diary/log.

National Occupation Classification (NOC).

@import "Assets/table-4.1.png"
@import "Assets/figure-4.5.png"

#### 4: Verifying Information

Verify with

- Workers currently performing the job
- Supervisors

Increases validity and reliability

- Inconsistencies/Concerns can be addressed
- Participants will be more honest

#### 5: Writing Job Descriptions and Job Specifications

##### Job Description

Statement of duties, responsibilities, reporting relationships, and working conditions of the job.

##### Job Specifications

Statement of requisite knowledge, skills, and abilities needed to perform the job.

- Answers the question "What human traits and experience are required to do this job?"
- All listed qualifications are bona fide occupational requirements (BFORs)
- Unjustifiably high educational/experience requirements may lead to systemic discrimination
- Qualifications of incumbents should not be confused with the minimum requirements.
- For entry-level jobs, identify actual physical and mental demands.

##### Job Identification

The job identification section generally contains several categories of information.  
The position title specifies the title of the job.  
The department and location are also indicated, along with the title of the immediate supervisor.

##### Job Summary

Describes the general nature of the job, listing only its major functions or activities.

##### Relationships

The jobholder's relationships with others inside and outside the organization

##### Duties and Responsibilities

Presents a detailed list of the job's major duties and responsibilities.

##### Authority

Define the limits of the jobholder's authority, including his or her decision-making authority, direct supervision of other employees, and budgetary limitations.

##### Performance Standards/Indicators

Some job descriptions contain a performance standards/indicators section, which indicates the standards the employee is expected to achieve in each of the job description's main duties and responsibilities.

##### Physical Demands Analysis

Identification of the senses used and the type, frequency, and amount of physical effort involved in a job.

##### Human Rights Legislation Considerations

- Not legally required but highly advisable.
- Essential job duties should be clearly identified.
- The only criteria examined should be knowledge, skills, and abilities required for the essential duties of the job.
- When an employee cannot perform an essential duty because of reasons related to a prohibited ground, reasonable accommodation to the point of undue hardship is required.

#### 6: Communication and Preparedness for Revisions

- Communicate to all relevant stakeholders
- Anticipate modifications
	- Restructuring
	- New product development
	- Technological changes
	- Competitors

@import "Assets/table-4.2.png"

## Chapter 5, Human Resource Planning

### Strategic Importance of HRP

**Defn.** (Human Resources Planning)  
Process of forecasting future human resources requirements to ensure that the organization will have the required number of employees with the necessary skills to meet its strategic objectives.

Helps organization to:

- Meet strategic goals and objectives
- Achieve economies in hiring new workers
- Make major market labour demands successfully
- Anticipate and avoid shortages and surpluses of human resources
- Control or reduce labour costs

@import "Assets/figure-5.1.png"

#### Relationship Between HRP and Strategic Planning

An HR plan does not occur independently of the other departments within an organization.

The HRP must align with the overall goals of the organization as well as both the long-term and short-term strategic plans set by the organization.

#### Importance of Environmental Scanning

External environmental factors monitored include:

- Economic conditions
- Market and competitive trends
- New or revised laws relating to HR
- Social concerns (health care, childcare, educational priorities)
- Technological changes
- Demographic trends

### Steps in the HRP Process

#### Step 1: Forecasting the Availability of Candidates (Supply)

Skills inventories and management inventories.  
Replacement charts and replacement summaries.  
Succession planning.  
Markov Analysis.

**Defn.** (Skills Inventories)  
Summary of current employees' education, experience, interests, and skills.  
Used to identify eligibility for transfer/promotion.

**Defn.** (Management Inventories)  
Summary of management employees qualifications, skills, interests, managerial responsibilities.  
Used to identify eligibility for transfer/promotion.

**Defn.** (Replacement Charts)  
Depicting of who will replace whom in the event of a job opening.  
Internal candidates age, present performance rating, and promotability status are listed.

**Defn.** (Replacement Summaries)  
Lists of likely replacements for each position.  
Indicates relative strengths/weaknesses, current position, performance, promotability, age, and experience.

**Defn.** (Succession Planning)  
Ensuring supply of successor for key jobs so that careers can be effectively planned and managed.  
Includes:

- Analysis of demand for managers and professionals
- Audit and projection of likely future supply
- Planning individual career paths, career counseling
- Accelerated promotions
- Planned strategic recruitment

**Defn.** (Markov Analysis)  
A method of forecasting internal labour supply that involves tracking the pattern of employee movements through various jobs and developing a transitional probability matrix.

@import "Assets/figure-5.3.png"

##### Forecasting Supply of External Candidates

Market conditions assessed:

- General economic conditions
	- Interest rates, wage rates, inflation, unemployment rates
- Labour market conditions
	- Demographics: education levels, age, gender, marital status
- Occupational market conditions
	- Relevant occupations (as applicable): e.g. engineers, skilled labour, accountants, etc.

#### Step 2: Forecasting Future HR Needs (Demand)

Factors to consider:

1. _projected turnover_ as a result of resignations or terminations
2. _quality and nature of employees_ in relation to what management sees as the changing need of the organization
3. _decisions to upgrade_ th quality of products or services or _enter into new markets_, which might change the required employee skill mix
4. _planned technological and administrative changes aimed at increasing productivity and reducing employee head count_
5. the _financial resources_ available to each department

##### Quantitative Approaches

**Defn.** (Trend Analysis)  
Predict future needs based on past employment levels.

**Defn.** (Ratio Analysis)  
Ratio of business activity and number of employees needed, e.g. sales revenue per salesperson.

**Defn.** (Scatter Plot)  
Used to determined whether two factors (business activity and staffing levels) are related.

**Defn.** (Regression Analysis)  
Examines the statistical relationship between business activity and employees.

##### Qualitative Approaches

**Defn.** (Nominal Group Technique)  
Involves a group of experts meeting face to face.  
Steps include independent idea generation, clarification and open discussion, and private assessment.  
Drawback includes subjectivity and the potential for group pressure to lead to a less accurate assessment than could be obtained through other means.

**Defn.** (Delphi Technique)  
Judgmental forecasting method involving outside experts as well as organizational employees.  
Ideas are exchanged without face-to-face interaction and feedback is used to fine-tune until consensus is reached.  
Drawbacks include the fact that judgement may not efficiently use objective data, the time and costs involved, and the potential difficulty in integrating diverse opinions.

#### Step 3: Planning and Implementing HR Programs to Balance Supply and Demand

**Defn.** (Staffing Table)  
A pictorial representation of all jobs within the organization, along with the number of current incumbents and future employment requirements (monthly or yearly) for each.

@import "Assets/figure-5.5.png"

**Defn.** (Labour Surplus)  
The internal supply of employees exceeds the organization's forecasted demand.

**Defn.** (Labour Shortage)  
Internal supply of HR cannot meet the organization's needs.

**Defn.** (Labour Equilibrium)  
Rare, no new action, maintain existing transfer and recruitment plans.

##### Responding to a Labour Surplus

Hiring freeze (openings are filled by reassigning current employees and no outsiders are hired)/attrition (normal separation of employees from an organization because of resignation, retirement, or death).  
Early retirement buyout programs; drawback is the packages often require a great deal of money upfront; early retirement must be voluntary (otherwise human rights legislation contravention).  
Job sharing (divide duties of a single position between two or more employees).  
Work sharing (work three or four days a week and receive EI benefits on non-workday(s)).  
Reduced workweek (work fewer hours for less pay).  
Layoff ("temporary").  
Termination (can never return).  
Leave of absence (allows those who may be interested in taking time away from work for a variety of reasons to have a set period of time away from their position without pay, but with a guarantee that their job will be available upon their return).

Considerations:

- Survivor syndrome
	- A range of negative emotions experienced by employees remaining after a major restructuring initiative, which can include feelings of betrayal or violation, guilt, or detachment, and can result in stress symptoms, including depression, increased errors, and reduced performance
- Supplemental unemployment benefits (SUBs)
	- top-up of EI benefits to bring income levels closer to what an employee would receive if on the job
- Severance package
	- For those being terminated (to avoid wrongful dismissal lawsuits)
- Pay
- Benefits
- Golden parachute
- Outplacement assistance

##### Responding to a Labour Shortage

Internal solutions:

- Transfer
	- movement from one job to another that is relatively equal in pay, responsibility, or organizational level
- Promotion
	- movement from one job to another that is higher in pay, responsibility, or organizational level, usually based on merit, seniority, or a combination of both
- Employee retention

External solutions:

- Recruiting

## Chapter 6, Recruitment

### Strategic Importance of Recruitment

The process of searching out and attracting qualified job applicants, which begins with identification of a position that requires staffing and is completed when resumes and/or completed application forms are received from an adequate number of applicants.

**Defn.** (Recruiter)  
A specialist in recruitment, whose job it is to find and attract capable candidates.

#### Employer Branding

The image of an organization based on the benefits of being employed by that organization.  
Includes experiences a candidate goes through during the recruitment process, including:

- Experience when they go to the company's website
- Acknowledgement thanking candidate who sends in a resume
- Initial greeting by the receptionist
- Ability of the interviewer to articulate organization's values and culture

##### Three Steps

Define the target audience, where to find them, and what they want from an employer.

Develop the employee value proposition, and the reasons why the organization is a more attractive employer.

Communicate the brand by incorporating the value proposition into all recruitment efforts.

### The Recruitment Process

@import "Assets/figure-6.1.png"

### Developing and Using Application Forms

Most firms use a standard application form:

- Facilitates comparison of candidates
- Information that the company requires is specifically requested
- May be used as a sample of the candidate's own work
- Includes a written authorization for reference checking
- Includes acknowledge that the information provided is true and accurate
- Many application forms include an optional section regarding designated group member status

#### Application Types

**Defn.** (Biographical Information Blank) BIB  
A detailed job application form requesting biographical data found to be predictive of success on the job, pertaining to background, experiences, and preferences.  
Responses are scored.

**Defn.** (Online Applications)
Reduce risk of lost applications.  
Increase exposure level of job and may reduce biases based on face-to-face meetings.

### Recruitment Avenues: Recruiting from Within the Organization

**Defn.** (Human Capital Theory)  
The accumulation of firm-specific knowledge and experience involves a joint investment by both the employee and employer.  
Therefore, both parties benefit from maintaining a long-term relationship.

**Defn.** (Job Posting)  
Notifying current employees about vacant positions.

@import "Assets/figure-6.2.png"

**Defn.** (Human Resources Records)  
Review of information on existing employees to identify candidates for openings.

**Defn.** (Skills Inventories)  
Review of qualification, interest skills of existing employees.

#### Limitations of Recruiting from Within

Rarely possible to fill all non-entry-level jobs with current employees.

### Recruitment Avenues: Recruiting from Outside the Organization

#### Advantages

A larger pool of qualified candidates.  
Availability of a more diverse applicant pool.  
Acquisition of new skills, knowledge, and ideas.  
Elimination of employee rivalry and competition for transfers and promotions.  
Hiring individuals who already have necessary skills reduces training costs.

#### Planing External Recruitment

Considerations:

- Type of job affects recruitment method chosen
- Yield ratios - percentage of applicants that proceed to next stage of selection
- Time lapse data - time from start of recruitment to new employee starting work
