@import "Assets/figure-4.1.png"

### Steps in Job Analysis

1. Review relevant background information
2. Select jobs to be analyzed
3. Collect data on job activities
4. Verify/Modify data if required
5. Write job descriptions and job specifications
6. Communicate and update information as needed

#### 1: Review Relevant Background Information

Organizational Structure

- The formal relationships among jobs in an organization
- Should be appropriate given strategic goals

Organization Chart

- Clarifies chain of command; who reports to whom
- Does not explain communication patterns, degree of supervision, power, authority, or specific duties

@import "Assets/figure-4.2.png"

#### 2: Select Jobs to be Analyzed

Necessary when there are a number of similar jobs.

**Defn** (Job Design)  
The process of systematically organizing work into tasks that are required to perform a specific job.

@import "Assets/figure-4.4.png"

##### The Evolution of Jobs and Job Design

Job Specialization (early-mid 1900s)

- Work simplification
- Industrial engineering

Behavioural Aspects (mid 1900s)

- Job enlargement, job rotation, job enrichment, team-based job design

Ergonomic Aspects (mid-late 1900s)

- Physical needs of workers

##### Competency-Based Job Analysis

Competencies: demonstrable characteristics that enable performance of a job.  
Shift from job-specific duties to competencies in a job descriptions; emphasis on employee capabilities.  
Examples of competencies:

- General (reading, writing, mathematics)
- Leadership (strategic thinking, motivating)
- Technical competencies for specific jobs

Use of competency analysis is becoming more common.  
It encourages workers to learn and rotate among jobs.  
More strategic approach to defining jobs.  
Supports performance management process.

#### 3: Collecting Job Analysis Information

Interviews (individual, group, supervisory).

Questionnaires.

Observations.

Participant diary/log.

National Occupation Classification (NOC).

@import "Assets/table-4.1.png"
@import "Assets/figure-4.5.png"

#### 4: Verifying Information

Verify with

- Workers currently performing the job
- Supervisors

Increases validity and reliability

- Inconsistencies/Concerns can be addressed
- Participants will be more honest

#### 5: Writing Job Descriptions and Job Specifications

##### Job Description

Statement of duties, responsibilities, reporting relationships, and working conditions of the job.

##### Job Specifications

Statement of requisite knowledge, skills, and abilities needed to perform the job.

- Answers the question "What human traits and experience are required to do this job?"
- All listed qualifications are bona fide occupational requirements (BFORs)
- Unjustifiably high educational/experience requirements may lead to systemic discrimination
- Qualifications of incumbents should not be confused with the minimum requirements.
- For entry-level jobs, identify actual physical and mental demands.

##### Job Identification

The job identification section generally contains several categories of information.  
The position title specifies the title of the job.  
The department and location are also indicated, along with the title of the immediate supervisor.

##### Job Summary

Describes the general nature of the job, listing only its major functions or activities.

##### Relationships

The jobholder's relationships with others inside and outside the organization

##### Duties and Responsibilities

Presents a detailed list of the job's major duties and responsibilities.

##### Authority

Define the limits of the jobholder's authority, including his or her decision-making authority, direct supervision of other employees, and budgetary limitations.

##### Performance Standards/Indicators

Some job descriptions contain a performance standards/indicators section, which indicates the standards the employee is expected to achieve in each of the job description's main duties and responsibilities.

##### Physical Demands Analysis

Identification of the senses used and the type, frequency, and amount of physical effort involved in a job.

##### Human Rights Legislation Considerations

- Not legally required but highly advisable.
- Essential job duties should be clearly identified.
- The only criteria examined should be knowledge, skills, and abilities required for the essential duties of the job.
- When an employee cannot perform an essential duty because of reasons related to a prohibited ground, reasonable accommodation to the point of undue hardship is required.

#### 6: Communication and Preparedness for Revisions

- Communicate to all relevant stakeholders
- Anticipate modifications
	- Restructuring
	- New product development
	- Technological changes
	- Competitors
