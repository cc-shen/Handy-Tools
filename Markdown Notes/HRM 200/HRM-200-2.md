# HRM 200 - Introduction to Human Resource Management

Part 2.

## Chapter 7 - Selection

The process of choosing individuals to fill job openings.

Strategic importance of employee selection,

- Quality of human resources determines organizational performance
- Inappropriate selection decisions are costly
- Significant legal implications

**Video Summary**  
Bad hires can cost the organization 1 to 2 times the amount they make a year.

**Defn.** (Selection Ratio)  
Ratio of number of applicants hired to total number of applicants.

### The Selection Process

#### Multiple-Hurdle Strategy

	- An approach to selection involving a series of successive steps or hurdles
	- Only candidates that pass a hurdle can move onto the next

Six typical hurdles:

1. Preliminary applicant screening
2. Selection testing
3. Selection interview
4. Background investigation/reference checking
5. Supervisory interview and realistic job preview
6. Hiring decision and candidate notification

#### Designing the Selection Process

Five steps:

1. Develop selection criteria
2. Specify _musts_ and _wants_ and weight the wants
3. Develop an evaluation form
4. Develop interview questions (for all candidates)
5. Develop candidate-specific questions

#### Acquiring Employees and the Law

Use selection criteria based on the job.  
Do not ask questions that would violate human rights legislation.  
Obtain authorization for reference checking.  
Save all records and information.  
Reject applications who make false statements.

#### Step 1: Preliminary Applicant Screening

Initial screening is performed by HR department.  
Application forms and resumes are reviewed.  
Candidates not meeting selection criteria are eliminated.  
Remaining candidates matching the job specifications are given further consideration.  
Increasingly popularity in use of technology.

#### Step 2: Selection Testing

Screening device used by approximately two-thirds of Canadian organizations.  
Assesses specific job-related skills, general intelligence, personality characteristics, mental abilities, interest, and preferences.  
Efficient, standardized methods for screening large numbers of applicants.  
Must be reliable and valid.

##### Reliability

The degree to which selection procedures yield comparable data over time.  
In other words, the degree of **dependability**, **consistency**, or **stability** of the measures used.  
Will the test withstand the test of time?

##### Validity

The accuracy with which a predictor **measures** what is intended to measure.

###### Types of Validity

- Differential Validity
	- Confirmations that the selection tool accurately predicts the performance of all possible employee subgroups
- Criterion-Related Validity
	- Extent to which a selection tool predicts or correlates with important elements of work behaviour
- Content Validity
	- Extent to which a selection tool (e.g. a test) adequately samples the knowledge and skills needed to perform the job
- Construct Validity
	- Extent to which a selection tool measures a theoretical construct or trait deemed necessary to perform the job successfully

##### Types of Tests Used in Selection

- Cognitive Abilities
	- Intelligence tests
	- Emotional intelligence tests
	- Specific cognitive abilities
- Motor/Physical Abilities
- Personality and Interests
- Achievement Tests
- Work Sampling
- Management Assessment Centres
- Situational Testing
- Micro-Assessments
- Physical Examinations, Substance Abuse Testing, Polygraphs

#### Step 3: The Selection Interview

| Interviewer Objectives | Applicant Objectives |
| --- | --- |
| assess qualifications | present positive image |
| observe behaviour | sell their skills and attributes |
| predict future performance | gather information about job and organization |
| communicate information about job, promote organization |
| determine how well applicant would fit in |

##### Types of Interviews

Degree of Structure,  
Unstructured, structured, or mixed/semi-structured.

Content,  
Situational, behavioural.

Administering the Interview,  
One-on-one or panel; sequentially or all at once; face-to-face or technology enabled.

##### Common Interviewing Mistakes

- Poor planning
	- Poor interview structures
- Snap judgments
	- Irrelevant judgement that should not affect the scoring
- Negative emphasis
	- Score lower and lower due to initial poor response
- Halo effect
	- Score higher and higher due to initial great response
- Poor job knowledge
	- Should know enough to assess correctly
- Contrast error
	- Each candidate should be assessed based on the criteria, not between other candidates
- Influence of nonverbal behaviour
	- Scoring based on nonverbal behaviour, avoid those kind of discriminations (possible disabilities or cultural influences)
- Leading
	- Ask a question and pointing a candidate to what you want to hear
- Similarity bias
	- Favouring candidates who share similarities

**Video summaries**  
Review candidate information.  
Do not bad mouth past employee.  
Answer candidate questions, refrain from personal questions.

##### Conducting an Effective Interview

Planning the interview.  
Establishing rapport.  
Asking questions.  
Closing the interview.  
Evaluating the candidate.

#### Step 4: Background Investigation/Reference Checking

Verify accuracy of information provided.  
Includes:

- Criminal record check
- Verification of educational qualifications
- Verification of previous employment
- Performance-related references from past supervisors
- Credit check may also be included

Considerations:

- Obtain written permission
- Possible public sources (e.g. Facebook)
- Qualified privilege
- Negligent misrepresentation

##### Step 5: Supervisory Interview and Realistic Job Preview

Supervisor,

- is best qualified to assess job knowledge/skills
- can answer job-specific questions
- must feel comfortable with new hire
- can assess fit with current team members

**Defn.** Realistic Job Preview (RJP)  
Provides applicants with realistic information, both positive and negative, about the job.

##### Step 6: Hiring Decision and Candidate Notification

Compile information from all technique used.  
Evaluate information about each candidate.  
Immediate supervisor usually makes final hiring decision.  
Make offer that specifies terms and conditions of employment.  
Give candidates time to think about the offer.  
Notify all finalists who were not selected.

## Chapter 8: On-boarding and Training

### Becoming a Learning Organization

#### Learning Organization

An organization skilled at creating, acquiring, and transferring knowledge and at modifying its behaviour to reflect new knowledge and insights.

#### Orientation

A long-term, continuous socialization process in which employee and employer expectations or obligations are considered.

Helps to clarify the organization's expectations of an employee regarding his or her job, thus helping to reduce the new employee's first-day jitters and **reality shock** (also referred as cognitive dissonance).

**Defn.** (Reality Shock)  
The discrepancy between what the new employee expected from his or her new job and its realities.

#### Training

Short-term, discrete efforts in which organizations impart information and instructions in an effort to help the recipient gain the required skills or knowledge to perform the job at adequate levels.

#### Employee On-boarding (Orientation)

Procedure for providing new employees with basic background information about: the firm, the job.

#### Purpose of On-boarding

Part of ongoing socialization process.  
Helps reduce first day jitters and reality shock.  
Foundation for ongoing performance management.  
Improved productivity.  
Improved retention levels and reduced recruitment costs.

#### Socialization

Ongoing process of instilling in all employees the prevailing attitudes, standards, values, and patterns of behaviour that are expected by the organization.

#### Content of Orientation Programs

- Internal publications (handbooks, newsletters, company history)
- Facility tour and staff introductions
- Job-related documents and explanation of duties, responsibilities
- Expected training to be received
- Performance appraisal criteria

#### Responsibility for Orientation

HR specialist,

- Explains corporate information
- Follows up over time

Supervisor,

- Explains nature of the job
- Introductions of colleagues, etc.

Buddy or mentor,

- Assists with day-to-day items

#### Executive Integration

Identify position specifications.  
Provide realistic information to candidates.  
Assess candidate's previous success with integration.  
Announce hiring with enthusiasm.  
Stress importance of listening and demonstrating competency.  
Assist new executives with cultural norms and change.

#### Problems with Orientation Programs

- Too much information in a short time can overwhelm employee.
- Too many forms to fill out.
- Little or no orientation is provided.
- HR information can be too broad; supervisor's information can be too detailed

#### Evaluation of Orientation Programs

Employee Reactions: evaluate usefulness, job performance.

Socialization Effects: assess progress towards understanding norms.

Cost/Benefit Analysis: compare costs of program (e.g. materials, time) to benefits (e.g. fewer errors, rate of productivity).

### The Training Process

**Training**  
Process of teaching employees the basic skills/competencies that they need to perform their jobs.  
Part of organization's strategic plan.  
Considered investment in human capital.

**Development**  
Long-term preparation for future jobs.

#### Necessity of Training

A recent federal government report concluded that Canada's ability to remain globally competitive and manage technological change effectively is highly contingent on our ability to upgrade and renew the skills of our labour force.  
Increased training can strength employee commitment.

#### Training and Learning

Training is essentially a learning process.  
To train employees, therefore, it is useful to know something about how people learn.  
People have three main learning styles:

- _auditory_, learning through talking and listening
- _visual_, learning through pictures and print
- _kinesthetic_, tactile learning through a whole-body experience

Training effectiveness can be enhanced by identifying learning styles and personalizing the training accordingly.

#### Legal Aspects of Training

Ensure admissions procedures are valid.  
Training not unfairly discriminatory.

**Negligent Training**  
Occurs when an employer fails to adequately train an employee who subsequently harms a third party.

#### Step 1: Training Needs Analysis

**Task Analysis** (new employees)  
Break down job into tasks and skills.  
Determine where each task and skill is best learned.

**Performance Analysis** (current employees)  
Verify any performance deficiencies and determine whether they are best resolved through training or other means.

**Establish Training Objectives**  
Specify what the trainee should be able to accomplish after completing the training.  
Provide focus for trainee and trainer.  
Provide a benchmark for evaluation of the training program.

#### Step 2: Instructional Design

Prepare curriculum.  
Ensure training materials suppose learning objectives.  
Ensure the quality and effectiveness of program elements.

##### Traditional Training Techniques

- On-the-job training
- Apprenticeship training
- Informal learning
- Job instruction training
- Classroom training
- Audiovisual techniques
- Programmed learning
- Vestibule or simulated training

##### E-Learning

- Learning administered via computer, web-based technology
- Flexible, personalized and cost effective
- Types:
	- Computer based training (CBT)
	- Online training
	- Electronic performance support systems (EPSS)

#### Step 3: Validation

A step often overlooked.  
Ensures objectives are accomplished.  
Pilot study or run-through using representative audience.  
Collect feedback and assess participants.  
Make revisions based on results.

#### Step 4: Implementation

Roll out or schedule delivery by professional trainers.  
Train-the-trainer workshops may be required.  
Ensure trainers are familiar with content and presentation methods.

#### Step 5: Evaluation of Training

- Reaction
	- Were trainees satisfied?
- Learning
	- Did trainees learn what was intended?
- Behaviour
	- Was training transferred to the job?
- Results
	- Did training deliver intended results in the organization?

### Training for Special Purposes

- Literacy and essential skills
	- Functional literacy declining
- Customer service
	- Customer service certification program
- Global business and diversity
	- Global literacies: personal, social, business, cultural
- Teamwork
	- e.g. Outward Bound
- First-time supervisors
	- Increasing turnovers
