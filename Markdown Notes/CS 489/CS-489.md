### Course Overview

#### What is Machine Learning

"...field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed." -- Arthur Samuel (1959)

#### Learning Categories

##### Supervised

- Classification
- Regression
- Ranking

Teacher provides answer

##### Reinforcement

- Control
- Pricing
- Gaming

Teacher provides motivation

##### Unsupervised

- Clustered
- Visualization
- Representation

Surprise, surprise

#### Supervised, formally

- Given a _training set_ of _pairs_ of examples $(x_{i}, y_{i})$
- Return a _function_ $f: X \rightarrow Y$
- On an _unseen test_ example $x$, output $f(x)$
- The goal is to do well on unseen test data
	- Usually do not care about performance on training data

### Focus of ML Research

- Representation and Interpretation
- Generalization
- Complexity
- Efficiency
- Applications

### Collaboration with focal
